The Destruction is Real (TDiR) source files
===============================

_Community history:_

Started: 2000 <br/>
Ended: 2009

**The Destruction is Real (TDiR)** is a DBZ fangame mod developed for _Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II_ game, which utilizes the Sith engine.
The project was started in 2000. <br/>
Most of the source code is written in COG, the scripting language used by the game.

## Important note

Here in this repository, these files were extracted by opening `character.gob`, `tdircontrol.gob` and `tdirmiscfiles.gob` in a [Container Manager, a program from massassi.net](https://www.massassi.net/programs/gob/conman_09a.zip).

`character.gob` contains:
- cog/character.cog
- magic.dat
- moremagic.dat

`tdircontrol.gob` contains all other content, excluding `docs` directory and what is listed in `character.gob`.

`tdirmiscfiles.gob` was only extracted and modified to update `credits.uni` with the correct credits for the original authors (it came almost empty).

`docs` are included here, these come from the downloaded game.

The other files contained in `tdirmiscfiles.gob` and `tdircharacter.gob` are models, textures, sounds and UI binary files (inside these directories: `3do/`, `3do/mat/`, `mat/`, `sound/`, `ui/` ).
The contents of `Episode/tdirlevel.gob` aren't included here. To see some source files contents from `tdirlevel.gob`, look [here](https://github.com/LegendaryGuard/TDiR_level).
