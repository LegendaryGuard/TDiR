<p>Light Melee: Hold [Crouch] + [Melee] + [Direction] to perform the light melee attacks.
These are not very strong, but can be used very quickly.</p>

<p>Medium Melee: Hold [Melee] + [Direction] to perform stronger melee attacks. Moves can
be chained together! Holding [Back] causes your character to block. </p>

<p>Heavy/Knockback Melee: Hold [Jump] + [Melee] + [Direction] to perform heavy attacks.
These attacks will send your opponent flying back, up into the air, or straight into the
ground. Moves such as the uppercut, dropkick and an double axe handle smash will take time
to perform, but you gain another chance to attack your opponent as they hurdle through the
air! </p>
