<p align="center">This is the Basics Area. There are links inside that will lead to more
information, when available.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Movement</b><br>
</p>

<p align="left">In TDIR, there are a few basics you'll need to know about to get started.
We'll start with movement. Like many FPS games, you must move efficiantly and in a smooth
way. TDIR also requires efficiant movement, or you're going to find yourself a smoking
crater. In essence, most shooters are best controlled via a Mouse and Keyboard setup.
Below is a link to setups that the Staff uses, feel free to try them or even mix and match
them.</p>

<br>
</p>

<p align="center">Essentially you'll want to remember that having Movement keys and
Attacks in close positions, also things like Fly and Melee are going to be used
frequently!</p>

<p align="center"><br>
</p>

<p align="center">Another thing you'll need to make sure you do is <u><em><strong>rebind
your Jump and Crouch keys!</strong></em></u> In TDIR they're no longer a part of JK's main
key setup.</p>

<p align="center"><br>
<br>
<b>Flying</b><br>
</p>

<p align="center">To fly, you'll need to bind a key to &quot;Flight&quot;. Just like in
previous DBZ Mods, you push the button to turn it on, and push it again to turn it off.</p>

<p align="center"><br>
<br>
<b>Charging Your Ki and Leveling up</b></p>

<p align="center"><br>
Remember to bind a key to [Charge] and [Level Up]! When you run low on Ki, [Charge] will
regenerate your ki at a faster rate than normal (Note: Ki only recharges while on the
ground). When the Ki meter flashes yellow, you can push [Level Up] and your character will
advance to the next level of power! If you hold down [Level Up] for a few seconds, then
let go, you will power down. Power up again by tapping [Level Up]. Some characters (Like
the Sayajins) will change their forms, while others will not! Be careful to see if your
opponent is stronger than they look! (See PL Sense in Powers section)</p>

<p align="center"><br>
<b>Melee</b></p>

<p align="center">In TDIR the Melee is performed by holding the [Melee] Key and Pushing
one of the four directions (Forward, Back, Strafe Left, Strafe Right). Melee attacks can
be modified via [Jump] or [Crouch], resulting in different speeds and strengths of
attacks. Below is a link to the full list of attacks!</p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Ki Wave Attacks</b><br>
<br>
Your character is provided 7 Basic forms of attacks. 6 Ki Wave attacks, and the Melee
style which is described above. Each Ki Beam attack may be charged to 5 different power
levels. Also, each beam may be controlled from your fixed position. Once the beam has
fired, hold down the [Primary Fire] key and use your mouse to control the beam (Or look
keys if you insist on using a keyboard). If you are locked onto someone, the beam will
follow them. The below link will describe the Ki Wave Attacks.<br>

<p align="center"><strong><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Abilities</font></strong></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Abilities are your
non-agressive forms of attack.&nbsp; From charging your Ki to PL sensing, it's all under
abilities.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Challanging
opponents to one-on-one</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Unlike other DBZ
mods made for eye candy engines, TDiR has the most unique feature out of them all. &nbsp;
The challange button will allow you to fight a person one on one like a 3d fighter
game.&nbsp; You get a better view on your opponent and it's really fun.&nbsp; What you do
is lock on to the opponent you wish to challange and tap the challange button.&nbsp; If
you are challanged, press your challange button to accept and you will go into the
challange mode.&nbsp; You can take your opponent down any way you like, but be mindful
that it'll get fast and furious.</font></p>
