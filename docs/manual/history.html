<title>History</title>
<b><u>Genesis</u></b>
<p> In the beginning, there was me, Shred.  I had already released DBZ3.0, and the final fantasy mod for Jedi Knight, and all was well in 
the world of modding.  These mods, like almost every other JK mod at the time, were simple reskins of the game, replaceing the look and function of the 
weapons and characters.  With my limited knowledge of cog, and JK in general, I was satisfied that this was the best that could be done, thus leaving DBZ3.0 as the final version.
  Eventually, however, SL_Jedi_Bubba_fatt contacted me via ICQ, and proceded to tell me various problems with my mod, and the fact that he and some others work working on a mod that puts mine to shame.  
Never one to back down from a challenge, DBZ4.0 was born!</p>
<br>
<br>
<b><u>A Breakthrough</u></b>
<p> Looking to show up Bubba, I put a message board up on my website, where people could give me feedback and ideas.  Surprisingly, many members soon showed up (a testament to how much people liked my old mods I guess.)
  The mod progressed much like usual, more characters, and better models for the attacks. But it was still missing that extra something...
  Then one day, while I was showcasing the new spirit bomb sprite, someone said I should make the spirit bomb appear over the players head before throwing it. After thinking about it for a minute, I decided to give it a shot.
  I tried it and.. it worked on the first try!  From what I'd seen thus far, I had no idea you could modify the game to such an extent.  
This opened a whole new world of possibilities for the mod.  The next thing I tried, was to make the ball "grow" over your head, which also worked! The mod was really gaining momentum now. </p>
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Much needed help</u></b>
<p> Up to this point, Bubba had been the only beta tester I had.  I added real beams, auras, animations, etc. and eventually surpassed the mod he had been working on.  Unfortunately, he wasn't always online, and I needed to test things periodically.  
Thus, Raziel and then Ubuu were recruited to help me out.  Meanwhile ctsketch from the forum had been working on levels for the mod.  He completed quite a bit, at fairly good quality (for the time) so he joined up as well.  Eventually, we moved the website.  
ctsketch made us a layout, and we were hosted by JediNights.com, getting them a record number of hits on one of their messageboards.  The mod was going well, and we recruited Backslash and RiViN to help test.  After an annoying person decided to spam our boards, Vash (Bol_Shinigami at the time)  and sdrawkcaB joined us to help moderate the boards and beta test.  VC_Bel_Iblis makes us an excellent HUD.
  Then I hit a wall.  Jedi Knight would refuse to load up all the character transformations. I worked on fixing this bug for some time, always ending in failure. It was clear we needed someone with more experience in the workings of JK.  
Bubba put me in touch with Hell Raiser, who had previously worked on Rbots!  He wanted to fix the bug, and also do character specifics.  After learning that, indeed, JK would <b>not</b> load up all those models, he programmed us a launcher to get around the problem. And we were back on track!
 We spent many late nights working out the quirks of cog, making many more breakthroughs.</p>
<p> Along with character specifics, comes much more work. Animations, sprites, and textures all needed to be made. Burn, and Gsusnme had been talking with Bubba, and the decision was made to let them on board.  With a new animator and texture artist around, I was free to work on the many character models. Thanks to zykimotos 3do exporter, my models make a massive leap in quality from the old JED models.</p>
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Arrrrgh, the pain!</u></b>
<p> The Sith engine is really a devil in disguise at this point.  Not knowing exactly how it handled everything,  stuff didn't work for no reason. Projectiles wouldn't sinc over multiplayer.  Sometimes a transformation would work, other times it wouldn't. There was no apparent rhyme or reason for this. (oh, there was a reason, but it took us a year to figure it out!)
  We went on this way for a while. Frustration was high.  The sith engine, while being very versatile and letting us make almost anything we wanted, simply refused to work when you put it all together. To make matters worse, JediNights would occasionally go down, leaving us without a website or forums.</p>
<p> And to top it off...  We get kicked off of JN because someone uploads a bunch of dragonballz episodes onto the server! Luckily we get hosted by massassi.org.  A fleeting calm, as we are soon kicked out for the same thing! Aggravating, to say the least. ctsketch also leaves the mod around this time, Leaving Ubuu as the sole level creator.</p>
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Nowhere to go but up</u></b>
<p> Thanks to Hell Raisers brother, UltraCodeMaster, we get a new home at hellraiser64.com/tdir, and a new website thanks to oSiRiS. Due to the amount of problems the mod had, we decided to make it level specific.  The conversion to level specifics cleared up about 90% of our problems!  I felt that our levels are good, but they can be better, so I got to work redoing a some of them, fixing some, and making a lot of levels from scratch.
  Hell raiser gets bendy beams working, and the melee system is improved upon.  Later, he perfects the challenge feature, which takes the gameplay beyond what any of us thought feasable!  The large and small characters don't function seemlessly at this point, so we came up with a new character hierchy to support all 3.  In order for it to work, all the models had to be adjusted, and all the keys had to support 3 sizes!  Working from burns originals, the large and small versions were animated. There are still some problems though, the more beams, explosions, etc that we add, the less likely the correct player model would show up.  After kicking around ideas for months, I finally came to the conclusion that JK can only load up a certain amount of stuff. I set to work making a replacement file to swap out with JK's. It worked!
  All the correct files loaded up, effectively squashing the last major unknown! We could now add whatever we wanted with no ill side effects.</p>
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Current</u></b>
<p> This was an insane project. Over three years of work. The mod itself is to my knowledge, bug free, and will probably be the only game ever to encompass the whole DragonballZ universe. Though it may be missing some features of newer engines, this mod has the best gameplay, in my opinion.</p>
