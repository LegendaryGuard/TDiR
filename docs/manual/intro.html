<title>Intro</title>
<p> Finally. This is what you must be thinking. You're about to play DBZ:TDIR. Wow. We're proud of you! This intro is to let you know what you're getting yourself into, things like huge melee battles, beams flying all over the place, and of course, YOU flying all over the place.</p>
<p> Well sit back, and grab a drink, you're probably going to want to have a look around the manual before you start! Don't say we didn't warn you!</p>
